        <h1>My Settings</h1>
        <p>
            My DPI is set to 1200, and my in-game sensitivity is set to 50 (Windows default). <br/>
            I do not have movement prediction enabled. You can use it as a training wheel for wiggling, but movement prediction is troublesome to deal with by itself, and I don't recommend using it.
